### üëç Product Recommendations

Automatically recommend products based on the user&#039;s recently viewed items, increasing the likelihood of cross-selling and upselling opportunities.

### üé® Customization Options

By default, SparkRVP adds Recently Viewed Products in the identical style your WooCommerce template offers them, so you don&#039;t need to worry about the looks.

Want to customize the looks of the Recently Viewed Products on your website? Just go ahead and do so üòé. No coding skills required.

Did I mention that the products can also be inserted in a carousel (PRO) to become a slider?

### üìç You control the location(s) of the Recently Viewed Products

SparkRVP offers more than 8 WooCommerce positions to place a Recently Viewed Products section, like the Homepage, Product Detail page, Cart page, Checkout page, Products list page and User Account page.

Besides these fixed positions also a shortcode is generated to place the product recommendations on any position you like.

Do you want several sections (PRO) showing your Recently Viewed Products throughout your website, perhaps with a different design, number of products, etc? We&#039;ve got you covered as well!

### üì± Responsive Design

The plugin is fully responsive, including the admin area, ensuring a seamless browsing and managing experience across all devices and screen sizes.

### üèÅ Next, Next, Finish

### üìà What about analytics?
